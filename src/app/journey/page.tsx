          Ever since my childhood, I've been drawn to creating and solving
          problems. This is why mathematics has always been my favorite subject
          in school—it consistently presented challenges that pushed me to find
          solutions. In high school, I found myself torn between mathematics and
          philosophy, both of which made me deeply reflect on the everyday
          issues we face.

          I grew up playing on computers, and I'll admit, it turned me into a
          computer enthusiast. I was the go-to person for fixing computer issues
          for my friends and family, often consulting forums or videos—just like
          many developers do. This experience nurtured my autodidactic nature
          and deepened my love for technology.

          I began my journey with programming in 2020 when I was 16 years old.
          However, my battle with depression took a toll, causing me to hit a
          standstill. I picked up my studies again in 2021 and I've been loving
          it ever since. This experience has shaped me into a resilient
          individual who continually perseveres, never ceasing to learn and grow
          in the realm of programming.

          I began my career as a software engineer in 2022, specializing in
          backend development using Python, MySQL, and VBA. During this time, I
          worked on creating Robotic Process Automation (RPA) solutions and
          streamlined processes for automation. This experience solidified my
          understanding of algorithms, logic, UML, databases, and the dynamics
          of a technology team. After six months, I transitioned to using NodeJS
          as part of my tech stack, integrating technologies such as TypeScript,
          NestJS, and TypeORM, while continuing with MySQL. This period was
          transformative as I honed my skills in CRUD operations, API
          development, and project architecture and realized the significance of
          documentation and the impact of agile methodologies on productivity.
          Another six months later, I delved into frontend development, working
          with React, Next.js, and Tailwind. This phase enriched my perspective
          on the client side of applications, and interface design, and
          underscored the notion that FrontEnd development is as challenging and
          rewarding as backend. It's a journey I genuinely relish.
